Loan Origination & Approval System — 
Node.js + React Project  
1. Project Overview 
This project evaluates your ability to design and implement a full-stack Loan Origination & 
Approval System using Node.js (Express) for the backend, MongoDB (Mongoose) for 
the database, and React for the frontend. 

Purpose: Create a digital loan management system that allows customers to apply for 
loans, calculates eligibility, and enables loan officers to review, approve, or reject 
applications. 

Learning Goals: 

●​ Design a modular backend using Express + Mongoose.​
 

●​ Model complex relationships between Customers, Loans, and Officers using 
MongoDB references.​
 

●​ Implement secure JWT authentication and role-based access control.​
 

●​ Build a responsive React frontend that consumes REST APIs.​
 

Key Challenge: Efficiently model the many-to-many relationships between customers, loan 
officers, and applications, while maintaining consistency in eligibility scoring and approval 
tracking. 

 

2. Problem Statement 
Build a platform where: 

●​ Customers can register, apply for loans, and view their application status.​
 

●​ Loan Officers can review loan applications, assess eligibility, and approve or reject 
them.​
 

●​ The system automatically evaluates loan applications based on defined financial 
parameters (e.g., income, credit score, amount requested).​
 



All actions should be accessible via JWT-protected REST APIs, consumed by a React 
frontend. 

 

3. Actors 
Customer — registers, applies for loans, tracks approval status. 

Loan Officer — reviews and approves or rejects applications. 

Platform (Admin/System) — manages authentication, stores data, calculates eligibility 
scores, and ensures business logic consistency. 

 

4. System Modules 
Auth Module — handles registration, login, and JWT issuance. 

Customer Module — manages user details and loan applications. 

Loan Module — handles application creation, eligibility scoring, and approval. 

Officer Module — allows officers to view and manage pending loan requests. 

Each module should have separate router and controller files. Use Mongoose models for 
schema definitions and data management. 

 

5. Database Schema (Mongoose Models) 
Use separate collections with references where appropriate. 

5.1 User 

const User = new Schema({ 

  name: { type: String, required: true }, 

  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }, 

  passwordHash: { type: String, required: true }, 

  role: { type: String, enum: ['CUSTOMER', 'OFFICER'], required: true } 



}, { timestamps: true }); 

 

5.2 Customer 

const Customer = new Schema({ 

  userId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true }, 

  income: { type: Number }, 

  creditScore: { type: Number } 

}); 

 

5.3 LoanOfficer 

const LoanOfficer = new Schema({ 

  userId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true }, 

  branch: { type: String } 

}); 

 

5.4 LoanApplication 

const LoanApplication = new Schema({ 

  customerId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Customer', required: true }, 

  officerId: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'LoanOfficer' }, 

  amountRequested: { type: Number, required: true }, 

  tenureMonths: { type: Number, required: true }, 

  interestRate: { type: Number }, 

  status: { type: String, enum: ['PENDING','APPROVED','REJECTED'], default: 'PENDING' }, 

  eligibilityScore: { type: Number } 

}, { timestamps: true }); 

 



 

6. Loan Evaluation Logic (MongoDB Aggregation) 
Goal: For each loan application, compute an eligibilityScore using income, creditScore, and 
requested amount. 

Suggested Logic: 

●​ Normalize income and creditScore to a 0–1 scale.​
 

●​ Compute score = (0.6 * creditScoreNorm) + (0.4 * incomeNorm).​
 

●​ Compare against loan amount threshold.​
 

●​ If score ≥ threshold → status = APPROVED; else → status = REJECTED.​
 

Implementation: Create a loanService.evaluateLoan(applicationId) function 
that: 

1.​ Fetches application and linked customer data.​
 

2.​ Computes score.​
 

3.​ Updates eligibilityScore and status fields.​
 

7. Backend API Requirements 
All endpoints (except /auth/*) require a valid JWT in the header: Authorization: 
Bearer <token>. 

7.1 Auth Module 

POST /auth/register — Register as Customer or Officer. 

{ 

  "name": "Ravi Kumar", 

  "email": "ravi@example.com", 

  "password": "P@ssw0rd", 

  "role": "CUSTOMER" 

} 



 

Response: { "message": "User registered successfully", "userId": 
"<ObjectId>" } 

POST /auth/login — Login and receive JWT. 

{ "email": "ravi@example.com", "password": "P@ssw0rd" } 

 

Response: { "token": "<jwt>", "userId": "<ObjectId>", "role": 
"CUSTOMER" } 

7.2 Loan Module 

POST /loans/apply — Create a new loan application. 

{ 

  "customerId": "<ObjectId>", 

  "amountRequested": 500000, 

  "tenureMonths": 24 

} 

 

Response: { "loanId": "<ObjectId>", "message": "Loan application 
submitted." } 

GET /loans/:id/status — Fetch status and eligibility score.​
 Response: { "status": "APPROVED", "eligibilityScore": 0.82 } 

7.3 Officer Module 

GET /officer/loans/pending — Get all pending loan applications.​
 POST /officer/loans/:id/review — Approve/Reject loan. 

 

8. JWT Authentication 
●​ Tokens are signed using a secret key stored in environment variables.​

 



●​ Payload: { userId, role, iat }.​
 

●​ Middleware validates the token and attaches req.user.​
 

●​ Role-based access ensures only officers can approve/reject loans.​
 

 

9. React Frontend Requirements 
Core Concepts: 

●​ React functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)​
 

●​ Routing with react-router-dom​
 

●​ Axios for API communication with JWT header​
 

●​ Toast notifications (react-toastify)​
 

●​ Context-based role management​
 

Key Components: 

●​ Login, Register​
 

●​ Customer Dashboard: Apply Loan, Track Status​
 

●​ Officer Dashboard: Review Loans, Approve/Reject​
 

●​ Shared Components: Navbar, Loader, ToastContainer​
 

 

10. Expected Outcome 
Deliver: 

●​ Modular Node.js backend with MongoDB.​
 

●​ JWT-based authentication.​
 



●​ Automatic loan eligibility scoring logic.​
 

●​ React frontend integrated with backend APIs.​
 

 

11. Submission Requirements

/backend 

/frontend 

 

Include in README: 

●​ Setup instructions and environment variables​
 

●​ MongoDB connection and seed data setup​

Good Luck!
